In this project, we aimed to predict Netflix's stock prices using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the steps we followed, the methods we used, and the reasoning behind them:

### 1. Data Understanding and Preparation
We started with a dataset consisting of Netflix's historical stock prices with features such as Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. The first step in the project was understanding this time-series data and preparing it for the model. This involved:

- **Normalization**: We used the `MinMaxScaler` to scale the feature values to a range of [0, 1]. Normalization is crucial for neural network models as it ensures consistent data ranges and helps in faster convergence during training.

- **Handling Missing Values**: Although our small sample dataset didn't have missing values, we discussed using methods like forward fill to address this issue in larger datasets.

### 2. Time Windowing
We transformed the time-series data into a supervised learning problem using the time windowing technique. We chose a window size that determines how many past days' data would be used to predict the next day’s stock price. The reason for this approach is that it allows the model to learn from sequences of data, capturing temporal dependencies and trends.

### 3. Dataset Splitting
We split the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance. It's essential to do this without shuffling the data to maintain the sequence's chronological order.

### 4. CNN Model Building
We chose a CNN model, which is generally used for image data but can also be adapted for time-series prediction due to its ability to detect patterns across the temporal dimension. The model was constructed with:

- **Conv1D Layer**: To extract features from the sequence data.
- **MaxPooling1D Layer**: To reduce the dimensionality and extract the most prominent features.
- **Flatten Layer**: To convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D feature vector.
- **Dense Layers**: To learn non-linear combinations of features.
- **Output Layer**: To make the final price prediction.

### 5. Model Compilation and Training
We compiled the model with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function, which is suitable for regression tasks. The model was then trained on the training data for a predefined number of epochs.

### 6. Model Evaluation
After training, we evaluated the model's performance using the test data. We calculated metrics such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R² to quantitatively assess how well the model predicts new data.

### 7. Visualization
We visualized the model's predictions against the actual stock prices to get a qualitative sense of its performance. The visualization showed that the model could generally capture the trend of the stock price movement.

### Summary
Throughout the project, we focused on creating a robust predictive model that could handle the intricacies of time-series data. The use of CNNs for this purpose, although unconventional compared to models like LSTMs or ARIMA for time-series prediction, showcased the flexibility of CNNs in capturing temporal patterns when data is appropriately preprocessed and structured. The project highlighted the importance of preprocessing steps, the careful construction and training of a neural network, and the evaluation of its predictive capabilities, both quantitatively and visually. 

The project's outcome was promising, with the model showing a good understanding of the general trends in the Netflix stock price data. However, due to the small size of the dataset used for demonstration, the results should be interpreted cautiously. For a more robust model, one would need to use a much larger dataset, potentially include more features, and consider other modeling approaches and architectures as well.
